# Ranjana Calligraphy Recognition API

A Django REST API backend for a mobile calligraphy learning application that recognizes and analyzes Ranjana script characters using deep learning. This API provides character recognition, handwriting similarity comparison, user authentication, and learning progress tracking to help users master Ranjana calligraphy.

## 📋 Quick Reference

```

## 🔧 Configuration

Database, media files, and REST framework settings are configured in `calligrapy/settings.py`.

Key configurations:
- PostgreSQL database (credentials in `.env`)
- JWT authentication with 1-hour access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
- Media files stored in `media/` directory
- Default permission: IsAuthenticated (overridden to AllowAny for ML endpoints in development)

API endpoints are defined in `api/urls.py` with 8 active endpoints.

## 📱 Mobile App Integration

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs up via `/api/signup/`
2. User signs in via `/api/signin/` → receives JWT tokens
3. Use access token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected endpoints
4. ML endpoints currently don't require authentication (development mode)

### API Response Format
All responses include a `success` boolean field and relevant data or error messages.

### Image Handling
Mobile apps can send images in any format - automatic preprocessing handles:
- Grayscale conversion and thresholding
- Smart cropping (removes noise, keeps character strokes)
- Centering and resizing to 64x64 pixels

All images are returned as base64-encoded strings for easy display.

## 🚦 Error Handling

API returns consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error description here"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- `200 OK`: Successful request
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input (missing image, invalid format)
- `404 Not Found`: Reference image not found for target class
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Model or processing error

## 🔐 Security Notes

**Current Development Status**: 
- ML endpoints (predict, similarity): **Open access** (AllowAny)
- User management (change password/username): **Protected** (IsAuthenticated)
- History endpoints: **Protected** (IsAuthenticated)
- JWT authentication: Active for protected endpoints
- Token lifetime: 1 hour (access), 7 days (refresh)

**For Production Deployment**:
1. Enable authentication for ML endpoints (change AllowAny to IsAuthenticated in views.py)
2. Configure CORS for mobile app
3. Enable HTTPS
4. Set DEBUG=False
5. Configure ALLOWED_HOSTS
6. Secure all environment variables
7. Enable rate limiting
8. Configure secure media storage

## 📊 Database Models

### User Model (Django's built-in)
Django's default User model with fields:
- `username`: Unique username
- `email`: User's email address
- `password`: Hashed password
- JWT tokens generated on signin

### PredictionHistory
Stores user's character recognition history:
- **user**: Foreign key to User
- **image**: Uploaded image file
- **predicted_class**: Class ID (0-35) returned by model
- **confidence**: Prediction confidence score (0-100)
- **created_at**: Timestamp of prediction

**Status:** Model exists but history saving is **currently disabled** (commented out in views.py)

**Purpose:** Track learning progress and review past recognitions (when enabled)

### SimilarityHistory
Stores handwriting comparison history:
- **user**: Foreign key to User
- **user_image**: User's uploaded handwriting image
- **reference_image**: Reference character image
- **blended_overlay**: Composite comparison image
- **target_class**: Class ID (0-35) of reference character
- **similarity_score**: Similarity percentage (0-100)
- **distance**: Euclidean distance between embeddings
- **is_same_character**: Boolean (True if distance < 0.45)
- **created_at**: Timestamp of comparison

**Status:** Model exists but history saving is **currently disabled** (commented out in views.py)

**Purpose:** Track handwriting improvement and provide visual feedback history (when enabled)

**Note:** To enable history tracking, uncomment the relevant code blocks in `api/views.py` (PredictView and SimilarityView)

## 🎨 Visual Feedback System

The API provides comprehensive visual feedback for both prediction and similarity endpoints:

### Prediction Endpoint
Returns the **preprocessed image** showing exactly what the model analyzed:
- **Grayscale** 64x64 image
- **Thresholded** and cleaned (noise removed)
- **Cropped** to character bounding box
- **Centered** in square canvas
- Returned as **base64-encoded PNG**

### Similarity Endpoint
Returns **three separate images** for comprehensive comparison:

1. **Reference Image**: 
   - Original reference character from database
   - Grayscale, 256x256 pixels
   - Shows the "correct" form

2. **User Image**: 
   - User's handwriting with **inverted colors**
   - Grayscale, 256x256 pixels
   - Inverted to match reference orientation

3. **Blended Overlay**: 
   - Composite image showing both characters
   - **Reference strokes**: Full opacity (100%)
   - **User strokes**: Semi-transparent (50% opacity)
   - **Overlapping areas**: Show where handwriting matches
   - White background for clarity

All images are encoded as **base64** and can be displayed directly in mobile apps.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Reference image not found" error**
- Ensure reference images are in `api/reference_images/`
- Check filename format: `class_0.png` through `class_35.png`
- All 36 reference images must be present (classes 0-35)
- Model does not support classes beyond 35

**2. Database connection errors**
- Verify PostgreSQL is running: `pg_ctl status` or check services
- Check `.env` file credentials match your database
- Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
- Create database if it doesn't exist: `createdb your_database_name`

**3. Model loading errors**
- Ensure model weights exist in `api/ml_models/weights/`
- Check file sizes: efficientnet_b0_augmented_best.pth (47MB), siamese_efficientnet_b0_best.pth (25MB)
- Verify PyTorch is installed correctly: `pip show torch`
- Try re-downloading model weights if corrupted
- Make sure you're using the augmented model, not the old 62-class model

**4. Image processing errors**
- Check image format (PNG/JPEG supported)
- Ensure image is not corrupted
- Try reducing image size before upload
- Recommended: 64x64 grayscale images

**5. Authentication errors**
- "Authentication credentials not provided": Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected endpoints
- "Token is invalid or expired": Sign in again to get new tokens
- "User not found": Check username/password during signin
- Note: ML endpoints currently don't require authentication (development mode)

**6. Media file errors**
- Ensure `media/` directory exists and is writable
- Check disk space for storing uploaded images

**7. CORS errors (when accessing from mobile app)**
- Install and configure django-cors-headers package
- Add allowed origins in settings.py

**8. ImportError or module not found**
- Ensure all dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Activate virtual environment before running

**9. Invalid class errors**
- Model trained on 36 classes (0-35 only)
- Ensure you're using `efficientnet_b0_augmented_best.pth`

**10. Preprocessing errors**
- If automatic preprocessing fails, API falls back to original image
- Check server logs for error messages
- Ensure images have clear contrast and visible strokes
